# Commit 1 - Pseudocode

# input: 90, 100, 95
# output: "A"

# Steps
# 1 - define a method that can accept an arbitrary number of arguments
# 2 - find the average of those arguments (sum them and then divide by the number of them)
# 3 - attribute the average to a letter grade using conditionals

# Commit 2 - Initial Solution

def calculate_letter_grade()
  # write code here  
end

# Commit 4 - Refactor Solution



# Commit 3 - Write Runner Code / Tests

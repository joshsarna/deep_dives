# Commit 1 - Pseudocode
=begin

Note: =begin and =end are a way of commenting out an entire block of code. It is not very common, but it can be useful.

input: 5
output: "5"

input: 1000000
output: "1,000,000"

input: "hello"
output: "hello"

Steps
1 - define a method
2 - check whether input is an integer
3 - return the input if it's not a string and convert it to a string otherwise
4 - insert commas every three indices from the right end, until there is only one digit left on the left

=end
